                Greetings, I'm Anthony Antoun, the founder of AÂ² Crypto
              </span>
              . My journey into the crypto world is not your typical one. With a
              background in civil engineering, I achieved top honors during my
              university years and embarked on an immensely successful career
              spanning various countries and prestigious companies, including
              France, Canada, Dubai, and Lebanon. Establishing my own thriving
              civil engineering office in Lebanon was a pinnacle achievement.
